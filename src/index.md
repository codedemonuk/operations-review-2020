## Performance

Note:

Performance Management Framework was refreshed when the Hertsmere’s 2020 Vision was agreed – attached the image for the 2020 Vision in case you want it.

The Performance Framework is overseen by the Performance Panel which is a Portfolio Holder Panel.
The Performance Panel is a cross party panel with representation across all 3 political parties.
The members of the panel are Cllrs Butler, Eni, Melville, Spencer and Swerling.
The panel meets quarterly and is supported by Liz Gore and Hilary Shade.

We have 3 sets of Performance Indicators for reporting at officer and Member level as set out below :

- Quality Service Indicators (14 in total) covering our key services – these are reported to the Performance Management Panel and the Executive on a quarterly basis.
- Key Performance Indicators ( 46 in total) across the services  - these are reported to the Chief Officer Board and escalated to the Performance Management Panel on an exception basis.
- Supported by a further 57 Management Information Indicators for the service areas – these are reported to the Chief Officer Board.

The Performance Panel scrutinises the Quality Service Indicators and may request further information or explanations of any performance concerns from the service area and can make recommendations for scrutiny committee consideration if considered appropriate.

During the last 12 months the areas which have been considered / queried by the Performance Panel included:

- Occupancy levels at council owned garage sites
- How the parks and amenities “grading” system operates
- Breakdown of motor vehicle crime types (to theft from, theft of and interfering with vehicle)
- Identification of a suitable performance indictor to measure service performance in housing
- Determination of planning applications within 8 weeks

The current Corporate Vision runs to 2020 and will need refreshing for 2021.

## Information and Digital Services

Note:

It has been another busy and successful year for the Information and Digital Services Team.

+++

### Business and Projects Support

Note:

The implementation of a new corporate GIS system, ESRI ArcGIS Enterprise, to better enable sharing of spatial data, for staff and the general public.
This product will support the Planning service improvement programme and allow better use of spatial data across the Council.

The team have worked closely with colleagues in the Planning Department to scan 50,000+ Planning images from the basement document store and add them to the Planning Document Management System.
This project has released the basement document store area for other use if the opportunity arises.

The team have also been working with colleagues in Asset Management to implement the Idox Uniform Estates Management module.
This will replace the current Estates Management system and consolidate the Councils’ property based applications into a single integrated product.

Other major projects have included the migration of the cash management system to a hosted environment (phase 2) - the system will become fully hosted this year and the implementation of a new, more comprehensive public facing Revenues and Benefits system (OPENPortal).

The team are also supporting the implementation of the new cloud hosted CRM system.

The team are currently working with the Infrastructure Team to ensure application servers are migrated to supported Windows/SQL versions, this work is ongoing.

### Service Support

Note:

This team provide first line IT support to all Council staff and members.
They are often the first point of contact for staff/members requiring assistance.

This year they have introduce a new and more comprehensive new starters induction process focusing on cyber security and information security breaches, as well as dealing with the ‘new’ Member induction in May.

They are continuing to generate income by providing IT support to the Hertfordshire Building Control company.
The team have automated the process for remote laptop support and supported the Microsoft Enterprise (software licensing) and new laptop procurements.

Information and Digital services have 2 apprentices who work as part of the Service Desk Team.
Both apprentices are performing well both at the work place and with their studies.
One apprentice is about to complete his level 3 qualification and will be moving to the level 4 qualification.
Both live in Hertsmere and the IDS apprentice scheme is proving to be a success for both the apprentices and the Council.

+++

### Infrastructure

Note:

There has been a lot of infrastructure changes in the last year.
Changes to the secure government email system has meant the decommissioning of the GCSX email environment and the implementation of the new dmarc email environment.
The team have continue the migration of email accounts to O365.
This project will be completed early next year with all but a few accounts migrated to O365.

A major project has been the decommissioning of a large number of Windows 2008 servers which will no longer be supported by Microsoft after January 2020.

The active directory servers have been upgraded in preparation for the roll out of Windows 10 with the new laptops in the New Year.

The team have work with the Society of IT Managers specialist to build an MS Azure infrastructure and migrated a ‘pilot’ copy of the Councils’ Revenue and Benefits system.
This project has not progressed as initially planned due to resourcing issues in both IDS and R&B.
However a plan is in place to move this project forward in the New Year.
Members of the team have completed MS Azure training courses.

The team have successfully maintained the Councils’ PSN compliance and have started work on next year’s submission which is due in February.
Cyber security continues to be a major challenge and the team are have and will continue to work to keep Hertsmere’s network and data secure.

The drive in the coming year will be to migrate the Councils’ major business systems from the current onsite infrastructure to a hosted and/or cloud hosted infrastructure.
The team will also be looking at how ‘modern ways of working’ can be implemented at the Council i.e. Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, agile working.
This will require consideration of available resource.
