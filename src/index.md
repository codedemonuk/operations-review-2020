## Community Safety

- Partnership
- Action Plan
- Youth Violent Crime Reduction Project
- Highlights

Note:

The strategic aims for Hertsmere Community Safety Partnership for 2016-2020 are to:

- Tackle crime, anti-social behaviour and extremism
- Build community confidence and increase the feelings of safety by empowering our communities
- Raise awareness and take action against domestic abuse
- Support and protect vulnerable people affected by emerging issues, such as child sexual exploitation, modern slavery and human trafficking

The partnership have identified the emerging risks in the borough and will work together to tackle these crimes before they become a top risk.

The partnerships action plan focusses on these risks, which are to:

- Identify and prevent serious Youth Violence, with a specific focus on knife crime
- Tackle illicit drug economy, particularly drug supply lines and protect the most vulnerable by curtailing the growth of county lines
- Increase feelings of safety and public confidence by reducing anti-social behaviour
- Tackle Domestic Abuse / Increase the reporting of domestic abuse incidents and raise awareness of domestic abuse and the services available
- Disrupt and deter criminals involved in child criminal and sexual exploitation and protect vulnerable victims

Some highlights from the action plan include:

- 7 events have been arranged across the borough to raise awareness of county lines, gangs and knife crime in schools, amongst professionals and in the wider community
- 8 workshops for students in Primary and Secondary Schools have been held to raise awareness of knife crime, county lines, exploitation, drugs and gangs
- Mini Police Cadets delivered to 11 primary schools within Hertsmere
- Hertsmere has secured 3 knife bins and have conducted over 13 knife amnesty events across the borough in conjunction with the nationwide Operation Sceptre campaign
- 23 vulnerable young people have been referred to the Constabulary’s Children & Young People’s Gangs and Schools team
- Referral of vulnerable people to the MIND Outreach Support Worker – since April 65 people have been referred and 32 are currently being worked with.
  To date 16 people have been discharged with ‘Goals met’
- The formation of the Multi-agency Risk Reduction Group (MARRG) which meets on a monthly basis to discuss all ‘anti-social behaviour’ cases, particularly where vulnerability is a factor in 15 different parts of the borough residents have been given the opportunity to complete anti-social behaviour surveys about the effect of asb upon them
- South West Herts Youth Action Project “Early Intervention” for Youth Violent Crime

Three Rivers, Watford and Hertsmere CSP’s are working in partnership and have developed a Youth Violent Crime Reduction Project in line with the Hertfordshire Serious Violence Strategy, to intervene and prevent young people from becoming victims or perpetrators of violent crime and associated behaviours.
This project aims to identify and share information amongst a multi-agency panel regarding young people of concern, as either perpetrators of crime, victims of exploitation or those at risk of either behaviours.
A number of referrals from Hertsmere have been made to the panel.
We now have a dedicated SOS Project Worker, from St Giles Trust, covering Hertsmere

Highlights of the year have been:

- Winning the  Mick Fogarty Award for Problem-Solving and then subsequently winning the Chief Constable’s award for Problem-Solving
- The establishment of the Hertsmere Community Safety Board which had its initial meeting last month

## Performance

Note:

Performance Management Framework was refreshed when the Hertsmere’s 2020 Vision was agreed.

The Performance Framework is overseen by the Performance Panel which is a Portfolio Holder Panel.
The Performance Panel is a cross party panel with representation across all 3 political parties.
The members of the panel are Cllrs Butler, Eni, Melville, Spencer and Swerling.
The panel meets quarterly and is supported by Liz Gore and Hilary Shade.

We have 3 sets of Performance Indicators for reporting at officer and Member level as set out below :

- Quality Service Indicators (14 in total) covering our key services – these are reported to the Performance Management Panel and the Executive on a quarterly basis.
- Key Performance Indicators ( 46 in total) across the services  - these are reported to the Chief Officer Board and escalated to the Performance Management Panel on an exception basis.
- Supported by a further 57 Management Information Indicators for the service areas – these are reported to the Chief Officer Board.

The Performance Panel scrutinises the Quality Service Indicators and may request further information or explanations of any performance concerns from the service area and can make recommendations for scrutiny committee consideration if considered appropriate.

During the last 12 months the areas which have been considered / queried by the Performance Panel included:

- Occupancy levels at council owned garage sites
- How the parks and amenities “grading” system operates
- Breakdown of motor vehicle crime types (to theft from, theft of and interfering with vehicle)
- Identification of a suitable performance indictor to measure service performance in housing
- Determination of planning applications within 8 weeks

The current Corporate Vision runs to 2020 and will need refreshing for 2021.

## CCTV

Note:

Hertsmere is a member of the Hertfordshire CCTV Partnership and has been since 2010.
In mid 2018 a Governance Review was carried out by Hertfordshire's shared internal audit service.
This review had 9 high priority findings and most of 2019 was spent implementing the recommendations from those.

A follow up final audit report was completed in November 2019 and said:

> Based on the work performed in this follow up audit, we have concluded that appropriate evidence exists to confirm that all nine of the areas highlighted in our original report are now complete.
> This outcome clearly demonstrates a positive direction of travel and step change in the governance and financial management arrangements of the CCTV Partnership.
> The Officer Management Board should be commended for its commitment and diligence in working in collaboration to implement the action plan and in its efforts to provide the Joint Executive with open and transparent reports on progress throughout the period.

In your agenda pack for tonight's meeting there is a more details report into the CCTV partnership.

### Business and Projects Support

Note:

The implementation of a new corporate GIS system, ESRI ArcGIS Enterprise, to better enable sharing of spatial data, for staff and the general public.
This product will support the Planning service improvement programme and allow better use of spatial data across the Council.

The team have worked closely with colleagues in the Planning Department to scan 50,000+ Planning images from the basement document store and add them to the Planning Document Management System.
This project has released the basement document store area for other use if the opportunity arises.

The team have also been working with colleagues in Asset Management to implement the Idox Uniform Estates Management module.
This will replace the current Estates Management system and consolidate the Councils’ property based applications into a single integrated product.

Other major projects have included the migration of the cash management system to a hosted environment (phase 2) - the system will become fully hosted this year and the implementation of a new, more comprehensive public facing Revenues and Benefits system (OPENPortal).

The team are also supporting the implementation of the new cloud hosted CRM system.

The team are currently working with the Infrastructure Team to ensure application servers are migrated to supported Windows/SQL versions, this work is ongoing.

### Service Support

Note:

This team provide first line IT support to all Council staff and members.
They are often the first point of contact for staff/members requiring assistance.

This year they have introduce a new and more comprehensive new starters induction process focusing on cyber security and information security breaches, as well as dealing with the ‘new’ Member induction in May.

They are continuing to generate income by providing IT support to the Hertfordshire Building Control company.
The team have automated the process for remote laptop support and supported the Microsoft Enterprise (software licensing) and new laptop procurements.

Information and Digital services have 2 apprentices who work as part of the Service Desk Team.
Both apprentices are performing well both at the work place and with their studies.
One apprentice is about to complete his level 3 qualification and will be moving to the level 4 qualification.
Both live in Hertsmere and the IDS apprentice scheme is proving to be a success for both the apprentices and the Council.

### Infrastructure

Note:

There has been a lot of infrastructure changes in the last year.
Changes to the secure government email system has meant the decommissioning of the GCSX email environment and the implementation of the new dmarc email environment.
The team have continue the migration of email accounts to O365.
This project will be completed early next year with all but a few accounts migrated to O365.

A major project has been the decommissioning of a large number of Windows 2008 servers which will no longer be supported by Microsoft after January 2020.

The active directory servers have been upgraded in preparation for the roll out of Windows 10 with the new laptops in the New Year.

The team have work with the Society of IT Managers specialist to build an MS Azure infrastructure and migrated a ‘pilot’ copy of the Councils’ Revenue and Benefits system.
This project has not progressed as initially planned due to resourcing issues in both IDS and R&B.
However a plan is in place to move this project forward in the New Year.
Members of the team have completed MS Azure training courses.

The team have successfully maintained the Councils’ PSN compliance and have started work on next year’s submission which is due in February.
Cyber security continues to be a major challenge and the team are have and will continue to work to keep Hertsmere’s network and data secure.

The drive in the coming year will be to migrate the Councils’ major business systems from the current onsite infrastructure to a hosted and/or cloud hosted infrastructure.
The team will also be looking at how ‘modern ways of working’ can be implemented at the Council i.e. Microsoft Teams, OneDrive, agile working.
This will require consideration of available resource.

## Customer Services

Note:

Project plan to procure a new CRM system completed.
A new ‘low code’ system, (Netcall), bought and implementation started.
The Customer Services Manager (Lee Gallagher) and the two Website development staff (Yiota and Mhiri) have all successfully completed their training to become accredited Netcall system builders and will help service staff and managers to build their service specific modules.
Lee has been involved in Netcall conferences in London and other locations, raising the profile of Hertsmere as a positive case study.

Various improvements to Customer Services facilities and processes recommended by the customer service review group have been implemented, including an internet hub facility in reception and a new appointment system for the Planning Duty Officer phone service.
Blinds were installed to the end cubicles to enable them to be used for officer/customer meetings where more privacy is required than the open seating area.

Customer Services achieved the highest rating - ‘outstanding’ when audited for Health and Safety compliance in the service.

Benchmarking of  Hertfordshire Customer Services in June 2019 showed that Hertsmere had the lowest waiting time for calls to be answered and was in the top 3 for the percentage of calls answered (96%).

The Website Improvement Project has made strong progress in the following areas:

- Council Tax
- Trees
- Licensing
- Land charges and property searches
- Street naming and numbering
- Waste A – Z page
- Commercial waste
- Over all web content structure
- Resolved issues with the development environment
- Council Tax
- Your council – Democratic services
- Environmental Health

Staffing in the service area has benefited from active succession planning and effective recruitment and retention of skilled staff including:

- The Customer Services Manager role was upgraded to Customer Services and Digital Transformation Manager.
  The post holder has recently  been seconded to the interim role of Executive Manager, working closely with the Interim Managing Director on a wider range of strategic issues including Climate Change.
- Parts of the Customer Services Manager role have been backfilled by internal promotions within the Customer Services Team at Team Leader level and the service continues to perform well.
- The Website and Digital Officer roles have been made permanent and filled by the staff who previously worked within the HCC shared service team, thus securing continuity for Hertsmere.
